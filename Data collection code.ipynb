For example, we could gather information like the number of followers, types, numbers of engagements, and the sentiments of replies and mentions for each account. Using different combinations of information, we can find out whether Twitter is an adequate social media platform. The relevant code for data collection can be found in the data collection Jupyter notebook.\n",

The polarity score is more important at the moment. I'll be making use of it to classify the sentiments.
